# Phase 5 – Optional / Not Applicable (SMS)

## Goal
Track features that are part of the wider OpenClaw ecosystem but do not map cleanly to Windows.

## Scope
- **sms.send** is marked as *not applicable* for Windows desktop.

## Status
- Not planned for Windows.

## Rationale
- Windows does not provide a standard, system‑wide SMS capability.
- Supporting SMS would require third‑party services and credentials, which is out of scope for a desktop companion.

## Revisit Criteria
- Only reconsider if OpenClaw introduces a desktop‑native SMS integration or if a cross‑platform messaging API becomes a core requirement.
